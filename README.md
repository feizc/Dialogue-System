3. We introduce an unsupervised annotation for visual expression with our model 
 

### implementation 

1. Pretrain the expression image feature extractor on the basis of efficientnet 

2. Multi-task learning on our model, i.e., utterance sentiment prediction 

3. Fine-tune with our model on new dataset
